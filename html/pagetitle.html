        <p>HTML Page Title<br><br>
            Every web page should have a page title to describe the meaning of the page.<br><br>
            
            The <title> element adds a title to your page:<br><br>
            
            Example<br><br>
            
            <html>
            <head>
              <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
            </head>
            <body>
            
            The content of the document......
            
            </body>
            </html>
            The title is shown in the browser's title bar:<br><br>
            
            
            The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.<br><br>
            
            The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.<br><br>
            
            The <title> element:<br><br>
            
            defines a title in the browser toolbar<br><br>
            provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites<br><br>
            displays a title for the page in search engine-results<br><br>
            So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!<br><br>
