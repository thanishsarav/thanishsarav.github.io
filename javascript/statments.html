            <h2>JavaScript Programs</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.</li>

            <li> In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.</li>

            <li> A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.</li>

            <li>In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
             <li> JavaScript statements are composed of:</li>

            <li>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</li>

            <li>This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":Most
                JavaScript
                programs contain many JavaScript statements.</li>

            <li>The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.</li>

            <li>JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>Semicolons ;</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.</li>
            <li>Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:When separated by semicolons,
                multiple statements on one line are allowed:</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. </li>
            <li>You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.</li>
            <li>A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li> For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.</li>

            <li>If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>JavaScript Code Blocks</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.</li>

            <li>The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.</li>

            <li>One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.</li>

            <li>Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.</li>

            <li>Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:</li>

            <li>Keyword Description
                <ol type="i">
                   <li> var - Declares a variable</li>
                    <li>let - Declares a block variable</li>
                    <li>const - Declares a block constant</li>
                    <li>if - Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition</li>
                    <li>switch - Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases</li>
                    <li>for - Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop</li>
                    <li>function - Declares a function</li>
                    <li>return - Exits a function</li>
                    <li>try - Implements error handling to a block of statements</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.</li>

        </ul>
    </ol>
