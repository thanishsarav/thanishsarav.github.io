            and diving, sliding run-outs of today can dazzle your eyes, stop your heart.
            Old school as old school can be, you may be a reluctant spectator to start with,
            but are inexorably drawn by the magic of the twists and turns of the shortest form of
            the game.Ones in, there is no way out.</text>
