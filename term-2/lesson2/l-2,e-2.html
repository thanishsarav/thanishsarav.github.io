        <h1>Cricket</h1>
        <p onmouseover="style.color='blue'" onmouseout="style.color='darkorange'">T20 Cricket. The flashing blades, breathtaking fours ans sixes, acrobatic catches,
            and diving, sliding run-outs of today can dazzle your eyes, stop your heart.
            Old school as old school can be, you may be a reluctant spectator to start with,
            but are inexorably drawn by the magic of the twists and turns of the shortest form of
            the game.Ones in, there is no way out.You  simply must stay up to watch 
            the last-over finish, even the post-match interviews, so complete has been the power,
            the drama the show has exercised over you.</p>
